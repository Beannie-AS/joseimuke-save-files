# Joseimuke Save File Archive

## Intro
A community archive of user-donated save files for (Japanese) joseimuke games, including Otome and BL titles, across multiple platforms.  
Intended for preservation, reference, and personal use.

This repository exists to help players revisit routes, access completed content, and preserve save data for story-focused games.

## Supported Platforms
- Nintendo Switch  
- PlayStation Vita / PSP / PS2 / PS1 
- PC (Windows / Linux / macOS)  
- Nintendo DS / 3DS  
- Other platforms are welcome if save extraction is possible

## How to Extract Save Files
Save extraction depends on the platform and game. Please ensure:
- The save file is user-generated
- No game assets, scripts, images, or audio are included
- Only the minimum files required for the save to function are shared

If extraction requires custom firmware, emulators, or tools, you may briefly mention this in **Save Notes**, but do not link to piracy resources.
